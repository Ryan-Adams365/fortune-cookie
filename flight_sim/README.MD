Final project for CS 162 - Intro to Computer Science II. This is a comedic, console-based game that simulates a regular flight in a way
you may find familiar. Included is all the code needed to compile the program along with a make file that can be used in a unix shell
with g++. It also includes design document that goes through my thought process and planning for this project. I am planning on improving
the game by adding a better graphical interface and the ability to control the game through keystroke instead of selecting options.
