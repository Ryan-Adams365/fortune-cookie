Final project for CS 340 - Intro to Databases. Code developed with parther Jeff Zhao. Uploaded code includes SQL definitions for
the relational database as well as the front-end HTML, CSS, and JS. Since I no longer have access to the OSU server to host the database,
I am working on setting it up through AWS.
